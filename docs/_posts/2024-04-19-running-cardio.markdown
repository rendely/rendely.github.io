A change of pace (pun intended) from software posts â€“ quick summary of the research I found on running cardio as I restart this exercise hobby.

## Starting to run again

My running journey began years ago in high school doing track and cross country. I never ran more than 5 miles at a time and competed in the 5k event as one of the slowest guys, never finishing faster than 23 minutes.

I took a break from running in college and returned to it when I started working at my first job in NYC. It was so fun running through Central Park that I got addicted and decided to start running races. I gradually built up my endurance, eventually training for and completing a marathon. However, like many runners, I fell out of the habit after reaching that pinnacle.

Fast forward to today, I'm excited to get back into running.

## Training with intention

This time around, I'm approaching my running with more deliberate intentions:

- Heart and cardiovascular health: Running is one of the most effective exercises for improving heart health. It strengthens the heart muscle, improves circulation, and can help lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
- Injury prevention: Many runners, myself included, have experienced setbacks due to injuries. I'm focusing on proper form, gradual progression, and incorporating strength training to build a more resilient running body.
- Enjoyment: Perhaps most importantly, I want to rediscover the sheer joy of running. There's a meditative quality to a good run that I've missed, and I'm eager to experience that runner's high again. I'm intending to do most of my runs outside, without headphones or other distractions to be present and mindful.

By keeping these goals in mind, I hope to build a sustainable running practice that will serve me well for years to come.

## Cardio science

To train effectively, it's critical to understand the science behind cardio exercise. There are two main types of cardio training: aerobic and anaerobic.

Aerobic training occurs at lower intensities where your body can supply enough oxygen to your muscles to meet energy demands. This type of training leads to several physiological adaptations:

- Increased mitochondrial density: Mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells. More mitochondria mean more efficient energy production.
- Improved capillary density: This enhances oxygen delivery to your muscles.
- Strengthened heart muscle: Your heart becomes more efficient at pumping blood.
- Enhanced fat metabolism: Your body becomes better at using fat for fuel during exercise.

Anaerobic training occurs at higher intensities where oxygen demand exceeds supply. This type of training:

- Improves lactate threshold: Your body becomes better at clearing lactic acid, allowing you to sustain higher intensities for longer.
- Increases VO2 max: This is the maximum rate at which your body can use oxygen during exercise.
- Enhances neuromuscular efficiency: Your brain gets better at recruiting muscle fibers efficiently.

Both types of training have their place in a well-rounded running program. However, for general health and endurance, a focus on aerobic training (often referred to as "Zone 2" training) is often recommended. Most experts are now recommending about 80% of training volume (miles run per week) should be roughly in Zone 2, and the other 20% at the highest (sprinting) Zone 5.

The rationale is that training in Zone 3 or Zone 4 is kind of this gray zone, where you exhaust yourself faster, and wear your body down faster but aren't building up your aerobic base more effectively. This can lead to not getting enough recovery. By focusing on Zone 2 you are able to run more miles per week total, which best improves your aerobic base for running more efficiently over time.

## Zone 2 intensity calculations

One of the most effective ways to build aerobic fitness is through Zone 2 training. This involves running at an intensity where you're working hard but can still maintain a conversation. But how do we determine if we're in this sweet spot? There are several methods:

- Heart Rate: The most common method. Zone 2 is typically 60-70% of your maximum heart rate. To calculate your max heart rate, use one of the many HR calculators found online.
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE): On a scale of 1-10, Zone 2 feels like a 4-5. You're breathing harder than at rest, but not gasping for air.
- Talk Test: If you can speak in full sentences while running, you're likely in Zone 2.
- Lactate Testing: More advanced, but provides precise data on when you transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. I haven't tried this yet and don't think it's necessary as the above tests are much easier and "good enough" for a casual hobby.

Personally, I've found a combination of heart rate monitoring (using my smart watch) and the talk test to be most effective. It allows me to stay in tune with my body while also having objective data to compare against in real time while running.

## Conclusion

I'm excited to apply this technique and see how it (hopefully) improves my performance and enjoyment of the running again!
