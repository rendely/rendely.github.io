## Overview

My fourth project in the Flatiron course was a [meal planning app](https://github.com/rendely/phase-4-project-meal-planner). I needed a way to let users plan meals for specific dates, which required figuring out how the Date type would work in 3 distinct areas of my code: (1) my db in SQLAlchemy, (2) my flask backend, and (3) my react frontend.

In this blog post I'll explain how the Date type is used across the entire stack and some helpful methods I learned along the way.

## Date type in Flask / Python

## Date type in React / Javascript

## Conclusion

There are a lot of gotchas to getting dates working correctly. I hope this guide can help you get started more quickly, as well as point you to further resources for handling more complex cases.
